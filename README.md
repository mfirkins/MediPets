## General Info
Version: 1.0, 11/03/2020<br>
MediPet was used as a small group project in collaboration with a group of medical students. I designed the GUI and Software for the project. It uses a Virtual Pet as a way to encourage and make sure prescribed medication is taken on time and at the correct intervals throughout a given day. The majority of the projects functionality is finished, but the health statistic functionality in the program has not been implemented.

Files in Repository:

-userData.txt: Auto generated from intial setup holds all data about user and medication

-health.txt: Stores the health statistics of character(the health stats function does not work properly as of yet)

-pillCount: Stores how many doses user has taken so far

-prevDose.txt: Stores when the user had the previous dose of medication

-MediPets.py: The main python script for the application

-keyFile.key: Auto generates an encryption key for the userData.txt file
